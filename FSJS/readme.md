# Q.1 `<!DOCTYPE html>` is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

üòÉ**Solution :**

Yes, `<!DOCTYPE html>` is indeed a tag in HTML, but it is more accurately referred to as a document type declaration (DTD) rather than a tag. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document to specify the version of HTML being used. The purpose of the document type declaration is to ensure that the HTML document is rendered correctly by web browsers. It helps the browser  determine how to interpret and display the content. Different versions  of HTML have different rules and features, so specifying the document type helps ensure compatibility and consistency across browsers.


# Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

üòÉ**Solution :**

Semantic tags in HTML are special HTML elements that provide meaning and structure to the content they wrap. They convey the purpose or role of the content within the document. Unlike non-semantic tags (e.g., `<div> or <span>`), which are generic and don't provide any specific information about the content, semantic tags have predefined meanings and convey the semantics of the content they contain.

Some examples of semantic tags introduced in HTML5 are `<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <figure>`, and many more. These tags give meaning to the structure of the document and help search engines, screen readers, and other tools to understand and interpret the content better.

#### Here are some reasons why semantic tags are important and beneficial in HTML:
- Accessibility: Semantic tags improve accessibility by providing additional context and meaning to assistive technologies like screen readers. These technologies can understand the structure of the content and convey it more effectively to users with disabilities.
- Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Semantic tags help search engines understand the hierarchy and organization of the content. Using semantic tags appropriately can improve the search engine ranking of a website and make it more discoverable by users.
- Readability and Maintainability: Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable and maintainable. By using tags like `<header>, <footer>, and <nav>`, it becomes easier for developers and designers to understand the purpose and role of different sections within the document.
- Collaboration and Consistency: Semantic tags promote better collaboration among developers and designers by providing a common vocabulary and understanding of the structure of the document. It enables consistent coding practices and improves code readability across the team.

By using semantic tags, you make your HTML code more meaningful, accessible, and maintainable. They enhance the overall quality of the web page and contribute to a better user experience. It is recommended to use semantic tags whenever appropriate to provide clearer and more structured content within your HTML documents.
  
  
# Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### HTML Tags:
HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of an HTML document. Tags are represented by angled brackets (< and >) and are placed around HTML elements. Tags are used to mark the beginning and end of an element, and they provide instructions to the web browser on how to interpret and render the content.

#### HTML Elements:
HTML elements consist of both the HTML tags and the content between them. An HTML element is a complete unit that represents a specific part of a web page. It includes the opening tag, the closing tag, and the content within those tags.

```Javascript
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
/*
HTML Tags:
<p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag.

HTML Elements:
<p> is the opening tag, "This is a paragraph" is the content, and </p> is the closing tag. 
Together, they form the complete paragraph element.

```

# Q.4 What are some of the advantages of HTML5 over its previous versions?

üòÉ**Solution :**

HTML5 introduced several significant advancements and features compared to its previous versions, bringing various benefits to web developers and users. 
### Here are some of the advantages of HTML5 over its predecessors:
#### Semantics: 
HTML5 introduced new semantic elements, such as `<header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, and <article>`. These elements provide better structure and meaning to the content, making it more accessible for assistive technologies and search engines. It allows developers to create cleaner and more meaningful markup.
#### Multimedia Support: 
HTML5 includes native support for audio and video playback without the need for third-party plugins like Flash. The `<audio> and <video>` elements allow embedding media content directly into web pages, making it easier to integrate and control multimedia elements.
#### Canvas: 
The `<canvas>` element in HTML5 provides a powerful API for drawing graphics and animations on the fly using JavaScript. It enables developers to create interactive games, data visualizations, and other dynamic content without relying on external plugins.
#### Offline and Storage: 
HTML5 introduced features like the Application Cache and Local Storage, enabling web applications to work offline and store data locally on the user's device. This allows users to access and use web applications even when they're not connected to the internet, improving the user experience and productivity.
#### Form Enhancements: 
HTML5 introduced several new form input types and attributes, such as email, URL, date, range, and more. It also introduced the `<datalist>` element for providing a predefined list of options. These enhancements improve the user experience and provide better input validation and data entry options.
#### Geolocation: 
HTML5 added the Geolocation API, which allows websites to request and access the user's geographical location. This enables developers to create location-based applications and provide personalized content or services based on the user's location.
#### Improved Performance: 
HTML5 introduced various performance improvements, such as asynchronous script loading with the async and defer attributes, which optimize the loading and execution of scripts. It also introduced new APIs for efficient data transfer, like WebSockets and Web Workers, which enable real-time communication and background processing, respectively.
#### Mobile Support: 
HTML5 includes features specifically designed for mobile devices, such as the ability to handle touch events, geolocation, and device orientation. It provides a more consistent and optimized experience across different devices and screen sizes.


# Q.5 What is the difference between `<figure>` tag and `<img>` tag?

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### `<img>` tag:
The `<img>` tag is specifically used to embed an image into an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag that does not require a closing tag. The <img> tag is primarily responsible for displaying the image on the page.
```Javascript
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
```
#### `<figure>` tag:
The `<figure>` tag is used to group together and semantically associate a self-contained content block with an optional caption. It is typically used to encapsulate media content like images, illustrations, videos, audio, etc., along with their captions or explanations.
```Javascript
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
  <figcaption>Caption for the image</figcaption>
</figure>
```


# Q.6 What‚Äôs the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### HTML Tags:
HTML tags are used to mark the beginning and end of an HTML element. They define the structure and semantics of the content within the element. Tags are represented by angled brackets (< and >) and are placed around HTML elements. Tags can be either opening tags or self-closing tags.

Examples:

`<p>`: Represents a paragraph element.

`<h1>`: Represents a heading level 1 element.

`<div>`: Represents a division or container element.

`<a>`: Represents an anchor or hyperlink element.

#### HTML Attributes:
HTML attributes provide additional information or properties to HTML elements. They are placed within the opening tag of an element and modify the behavior or appearance of the element. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (=). Multiple attributes can be added to an element, each separated by a space.

Examples:

`class`: Specifies one or more CSS classes to apply to an element for styling or targeting with CSS or JavaScript.

`id`: Provides a unique identifier for an element, which can be used for targeting the element with CSS or JavaScript.

`src`: Specifies the source URL or file path for media elements like images, audio, or video.

`href`: Specifies the destination URL for anchor elements.

#### Global Attributes:
Global attributes are attributes that can be used on any HTML element. They are not specific to any particular element and can be applied universally. 

Here are some examples of global attributes:

`class`: Specifies one or more CSS classes for styling or targeting elements.

`id`: Provides a unique identifier for an element.

`style`: Allows inline CSS styling to be applied directly to an element.

`title`: Adds a tooltip or additional information about an element.

`lang`: Specifies the language of the content within an element.

# Q.1 Whats Box Model in CSS & Which CSS Properties are part of it ?

üòÉ**Solution :**

The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how elements are structured and how their dimensions and spacing are calculated. It consists of four components: content, padding, border, and margin. Each component contributes to the overall size and layout of an element.
- Content:
```
 Represents the actual content of an element, such as text, images, or other nested elements.
 CSS property: width, height
 ```
- Padding:
```
Defines the space between the content and the border of an element.
CSS properties: padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left, padding
```
- Border:
```
Surrounds the content and padding of an element.
CSS properties: border-width, border-style, border-color, border
```
- Margin:
```
Creates space outside the border of an element, separating it from other elements.
CSS properties: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, margin
```


# Q.2 What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?

üòÉ**Solution :**

[Different Types of Selectors](https://anchal20.hashnode.dev/css-selectors-and-pseudo-elements)

#### CSS selectors offer several advantages:
- Selectors allow you to target specific elements or groups of elements, enabling customized styling.
- They provide flexibility, allowing you to apply styles to different parts of the document structure.
- Selectors support cascading and specificity, allowing you to control the order and priority of styles applied to elements.
- They enable the application of styles based on different states or conditions, enhancing interactivity and user experience.
- Selectors can be combined and nested to create complex and specific targeting.


# Q.3 What is VW/VH & How its different from PX?

üòÉ**Solution :**

VW and VH are CSS units of measurement that represent a percentage of the viewport width and viewport height, respectively. They provide a way to size elements relative to the size of the viewport, which is the visible area of a web page.
#### Viewport Width (VW):
```
        VW represents a percentage of the width of the viewport.
        1 VW is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
        Example: width: 50vw; means the element's width will be 50% of the viewport width.
        Use case: VW is often used for creating responsive designs where elements adjust their size based on the width of the viewport.
```
#### Viewport Height (VH):
```
        VH represents a percentage of the height of the viewport.
        1 VH is equal to 1% of the viewport height.
        Example: height: 80vh; means the element's height will be 80% of the viewport height.
        Use case: VH is commonly used for full-height sections or elements that should occupy a specific percentage of the viewport height.
```
#### Pixels (PX):
```
        PX is an absolute unit of measurement that represents a fixed number of pixels.
        1 PX is equal to one physical pixel on the screen.
        Example: font-size: 16px; sets the element's font size to 16 pixels.
        Use case: PX is useful for specifying precise dimensions and sizes that are not relative to the viewport size.
```
### Key differences between VW/VH and PX:
- Relative vs. Absolute: VW and VH are relative units that adjust their size based on the viewport dimensions, while PX is an absolute unit that represents a fixed number of pixels.
- Responsiveness: VW and VH are commonly used for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. They allow elements to scale proportionally with the viewport. PX, on the other hand, doesn't respond to changes in the viewport size.
- Viewport-based: VW and VH are viewport-based units, meaning their values are calculated relative to the viewport dimensions. PX, in contrast, is a fixed unit of measurement that remains constant regardless of the viewport.
    

# Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### Inline:
```
        Elements with display: inline are rendered inline, meaning they flow within the text content and do not start on a new line.
        Inline elements do not have a fixed width or height. Their dimensions are determined by their content.
        Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, and <em>.
        Inline elements cannot have vertical margin or padding applied to them.
        Inline elements do not create line breaks before or after them.
        Inline elements can have padding and horizontal margin applied to them.
```
#### Inline-Block:
```
        Elements with display: inline-block are rendered inline but behave as block-level elements.
        Inline-block elements flow within the text content, but they can have a defined width, height, margin, and padding.
        Examples of inline-block elements include <input>, <button>, and <img>.
        Inline-block elements do not start on a new line, but they can be positioned vertically using margin or padding.
        Inline-block elements respect line breaks before or after them.
```
#### Block:
```
        Elements with display: block are rendered as block-level elements.
        Block elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available by default, extending to the left and right edges of their parent container.
        Block elements can have a defined width, height, margin, and padding.
        Examples of block elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, and <section>.
        Block elements create line breaks before and after them.
        Block elements can have both vertical and horizontal margin and padding applied to them.
 ```       

# Q.5 How is Border-box different from Content Box?

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### Content Box:
- box-sizing: content-box; is the default value for the box-sizing property.
- With content-box, the width and height of an element are calculated by considering only the content area, excluding padding and border.
- This means that if you set a width or height on an element, the padding and border will be added to the specified width and height, resulting in the total width and height being larger.
- Example: If you set width: 200px on an element with 10px padding and 2px border, the total width of the element will be 200px (content width) + 20px (left and right padding) + 4px (left and right border), resulting in a total width of 224px.

#### Border Box:
- box-sizing: border-box; changes the box model behavior to include padding and border within the specified width and height of an element.
- With border-box, the width and height you set on an element include both the content area and any padding and border.
- This means that if you set a width or height on an element, the padding and border are subtracted from the specified width and height, ensuring that the content area remains the specified size.
- Example: If you set width: 200px on an element with 10px padding and 2px border, the total width of the element will be 200px, including the content width, padding, and border.


# Q.6 What‚Äôs z-index and How does it Function ?

üòÉ**Solution :**

Z Index ( z-index ) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. Note: Z index only works on positioned elements ( position:absolute , position:relative , or position:fixed ).


# Q.7 What‚Äôs Grid & Flex and difference between them?

üòÉ**Solution :**

The basic difference between CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.


# Q.8 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.

üòÉ**Solution :**

In CSS, positioning properties are used to control the layout and positioning of elements on a web page.

#### Absolute Positioning (position: absolute):

- Elements with position: absolute are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor, or the initial containing block if there is no positioned ancestor.
- When an element is positioned absolutely, it is taken out of the normal document flow and can overlap other elements.
- You can use offset properties (top, right, bottom, left) to specify the exact position of the element.
```Javascript
.container {
  position: relative;
}

.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 100px;
}
```

#### Relative Positioning (position: relative):

- Elements with position: relative are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow.
- When an element is positioned relatively, you can use offset properties like top, right, bottom, and left to move the element from its original position.
- Other elements on the page will still occupy the space where the relatively positioned element would have been if it were not moved.

```Javascript
.container {
  position: relative;
}

.box {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px;
}
```

#### Sticky Positioning (position: sticky):

- Elements with position: sticky are positioned based on the user's scroll position.
- A sticky element is initially positioned according to the normal flow of the document but becomes fixed (like position: fixed) once the user scrolls to a specific threshold (the "sticky" point)
- The element will remain in its sticky position until it reaches the end of its parent container.

```Javascript
.container {
  height: 800px; /* Add height to create a scrolling container */
  overflow-y: scroll;
}

.sticky-element {
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px;
}
```
#### Fixed Positioning (position: fixed):

- Elements with position: fixed are positioned relative to the viewport, meaning they stay in the same position even if the page is scrolled.
- Fixed elements are removed from the normal document flow and do not affect the positioning of other elements.
- You can use offset properties (top, right, bottom, left) to specify the exact position of the element relative to the viewport.

```Javascript
.fixed-element {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
}
```

# Q.9 What are Pseudo class in CSS & How its different From Pseudo Elements?

üòÉ**Solution :**

In CSS, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are used to select and style specific parts of an element's content based on certain conditions or states. While both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements enhance the styling capabilities of CSS, they have different purposes and target different parts of the element.

#### Pseudo-classes : 
Pseudo-classes select elements based on a specific state or condition. They are preceded by a colon (:) and target elements based on user interactions, such as hovering over an element, clicking on it, or focusing on it. Pseudo-classes are used to change the style of an element in response to user actions or dynamic states.

Here are some examples of commonly used pseudo-classes:

:hover - Selects an element when the user hovers over it.

:active - Selects an element while it is being clicked or activated.

:focus - Selects an element that has keyboard focus.

:first-child - Selects the first child element of its parent.

:nth-child() - Selects elements based on their position within a parent element.
    
#### Pseudo-elements : 
Pseudo-elements, on the other hand, select and style specific parts of an element's content. They are preceded by two colons (::) and create virtual elements that can be styled independently. Pseudo-elements are used to add decorative or structural elements to the content of an element, such as inserting generated content before or after an element.

Here are some examples of commonly used pseudo-elements:

::before - Inserts content before the content of an element.

::after - Inserts content after the content of an element.

::first-letter - Selects the first letter of the text content within an element.

::first-line - Selects the first line of the text content within an element.

In summary, pseudo-classes are used to select elements based on states or conditions, while pseudo-elements are used to select and style specific parts of an element's content.



# ‚Üê JavaScript ‚Üí

# Q.1 What is Hoisting in Javascript ?

üòÉ**Solution :**

Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that regardless of where the variables and functions are declared in the code, they are treated as if they are declared at the top of their scope.

In JavaScript, there are two types of hoisting: variable hoisting and function hoisting.

#### 1. Variable Hoisting: 
When variables are hoisted, the declaration of the variable is moved to the top of its scope, but not the initialization. This means that you can access the variable before it is declared in the code, although its value will be undefined until it is assigned a value.
```Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
```
#### 2. Function Hoisting: 
Function declarations are also hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that you can call a function before it is declared in the code.
```Javascript
greet(); // "Hello"

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
```


# Q.2 What are different higher order functions in JS? What is the difference between .map() and .forEach() ?

üòÉ**Solution :**

In JavaScript, higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They provide a way to abstract over actions, behaviors, or operations and can be used to write more concise and expressive code. Some common higher-order functions in JavaScript include map, forEach, filter, reduce, and sort.
#### map: 
The map function is used to transform elements in an array and create a new array with the same length. It applies a provided function to each element in the original array and returns an array of the results. The original array remains unchanged.
```Javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
// doubledNumbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
#### forEach: 
The forEach function iterates over each element in an array and performs a specified action for each element. Unlike map, it doesn't create a new array; instead, it executes a callback function for each element of the array.
```Javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num));
// Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```


# Q.3 What is the difference between .call() .apply() and .bind()? explain with an example.

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### call(): 
The call() method is used to invoke a function with a specified this value and arguments provided individually. It accepts the this context as the first argument, followed by the function arguments separated by commas.
```Javascript
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  }
};

const anotherPerson = {
  name: "Jane Smith"
};

person.sayHello.call(anotherPerson);
// Output: Hello, Jane Smith!
```
#### apply(): 
The apply() method is similar to call(), but it accepts arguments as an array or an array-like object. The first argument is still the this context, and the second argument is an array or an array-like object containing the function arguments.
```Javascript
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  sayHello: function(greeting) {
    console.log(`${greeting}, ${this.name}!`);
  }
};

const anotherPerson = {
  name: "Jane Smith"
};

person.sayHello.apply(anotherPerson, ["Hi"]);
// Output: Hi, Jane Smith!
```

#### bind(): 
The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has a specified this value and optional arguments. It returns a new function without invoking it immediately.
```Javascript
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  }
};

const anotherPerson = {
  name: "Jane Smith"
};

const greet = person.sayHello.bind(anotherPerson);
greet();
// Output: Hello, Jane Smith!
```


# Q.4 Explain Event bubbling and Event Capturing in JavaScript with suitable examples.

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### Event Bubbling:
Event bubbling is the default behavior in most modern browsers. When an event occurs on an element nested within another element, the event first triggers on the innermost element and then propagates upward through its ancestors, triggering event handlers on each ancestor element in the DOM hierarchy.
```Javascript
<div id="outer">
  <div id="inner">
    <button id="button">Click Me</button>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
  document.getElementById("outer").addEventListener("click", function () {
    console.log("Outer Div Clicked");
  });

  document.getElementById("inner").addEventListener("click", function () {
    console.log("Inner Div Clicked");
  });

  document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", function () {
    console.log("Button Clicked");
  });
</script>
```
When the button is clicked, the order of event execution is as follows:
```
    Button Clicked
    Inner Div Clicked
    Outer Div Clicked
```

#### Event Capturing:
Event capturing is the opposite of event bubbling. It involves the event starting at the outermost element and propagating downward through the DOM hierarchy, triggering event handlers on each ancestor element, and finally reaching the target element.
```Javascript
<div id="outer">
  <div id="inner">
    <button id="button">Click Me</button>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
  document.getElementById("outer").addEventListener(
    "click",
    function () {
      console.log("Outer Div Clicked");
    },
    true // 'true' enables event capturing
  );

  document.getElementById("inner").addEventListener(
    "click",
    function () {
      console.log("Inner Div Clicked");
    },
    true
  );

  document.getElementById("button").addEventListener(
    "click",
    function () {
      console.log("Button Clicked");
    },
    true
  );
</script>
```
When the button is clicked, the order of event execution is as follows:
```
    Outer Div Clicked
    Inner Div Clicked
    Button Clicked
```


# Q.5 What is function currying with example?

üòÉ**Solution :**

Function currying is a technique in functional programming that involves transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. The curried function allows you to partially apply arguments and create more specialized functions.
```Javascript
// Non-curried function
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

console.log(add(2, 3, 4)); // Output: 9

// Curried function
function curryAdd(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

console.log(curryAdd(2)(3)(4)); // Output: 9
```

Explanation:
1. The global execution context is initially created.
2. The console.log('First') statement is executed, printing "First" to the console.
3. The setTimeout function is called with a callback function and a timeout of 0 milliseconds. This schedules the callback function to be executed after the current execution context is completed.
4. The console.log('Third') statement is executed, printing "Third" to the console.
5. The global execution context is completed, and the callback function is executed from the event queue.
6. The callback function console.log('Second') is executed, printing "Second" to the console.

So, the final output is "First", "Third", and then "Second".

Explanation:
1. The global execution context is initially created.
2. The console.log('First') statement is executed, printing "First" to the console.
3. The setTimeout function is called with the secondCall function and a timeout of 2000 milliseconds. This schedules the secondCall function to be executed after a delay of 2000 milliseconds.
4. The second setTimeout function is called with a callback function and a timeout of 0 milliseconds. This schedules the callback function to be executed after the current execution context is completed.
5. The console.log('Third') statement is executed, printing "Third" to the console.
6. The global execution context is completed, and the secondCall function is executed after a delay of 2000 milliseconds, printing "Second" to the console.

So, the final output is "First", "Third", "Third", and then "Second".


# Q.7 What are promises? What are the different states of a promise? Support your answer with an example where you need to create your own promise.

üòÉ**Solution :**

Promises are a feature in JavaScript that allow you to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and readable way. They represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allow you to chain callbacks or use async/await syntax to handle the result.

A promise can be in one of three states:
#### Pending: 
This is the initial state of a promise. It means that the asynchronous operation associated with the promise is still in progress and the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
#### Fulfilled: 
The promise transitions to the fulfilled state when the asynchronous operation completes successfully. It means that the promised value is available, and any associated callbacks registered with the then() method will be executed with the fulfillment value.
#### Rejected: 
The promise transitions to the rejected state if the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails. It means that the promised value is not available due to an error, and any associated error handlers registered with the catch() or then() method will be executed with the rejection reason.

Here's an example where we create a custom promise that simulates an asynchronous operation (a timeout) and resolves or rejects based on a condition:
```Javascript
// Custom promise example
const delay = (milliseconds) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (milliseconds > 2000) {
        reject("Timeout occurred");
      } else {
        resolve("Operation completed successfully");
      }
    }, milliseconds);
  });
};

// Using the custom promise
console.log("Before promise");

delay(1500)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("Promise complete");
  });

console.log("After promise");
```


# Q.8 What is ‚Äòthis‚Äô keyword in JavaScript? explain with an example & create.

üòÉ**Solution :**

In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the context in which a function is invoked. It provides a way to access and manipulate the current object or context within a function. The value of this depends on how a function is called or invoked.
```Javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const john = new Person('John');
console.log(john.name); // Outputs "John"
```


# Q.9 Explain event loop Call Stack Callback queue and Micro Task queue in Your Words.

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### Event Loop: 
The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that continuously checks for tasks and events in the environment, such as user interactions, timers, or network responses. Its main job is to ensure that the call stack is never empty and that tasks are executed in the correct order. The event loop consists of two main components: the callback queue and the microtask queue.
#### Call Stack: 
The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the currently executing functions in JavaScript. It works on a "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the call stack, and when a function completes its execution, it is popped off the stack. This allows JavaScript to keep track of the order in which functions are called and return to the appropriate point of execution.
#### Callback Queue: 
The callback queue, also known as the task queue, is a queue that holds callbacks and tasks to be executed. When an asynchronous task or event occurs, its associated callback function is placed in the callback queue. The event loop checks the callback queue and, if the call stack is empty, pops the callbacks from the queue and pushes them onto the call stack for execution.
#### Microtask Queue: 
The microtask queue, sometimes referred to as the promise queue, is a queue that holds microtasks. Microtasks are usually generated as a result of Promise resolutions or certain API methods like queueMicrotask(). Microtasks have higher priority than regular tasks (callbacks) and are executed before the event loop advances to the callback queue. This ensures that microtasks are processed before the rendering and user interactions occur, improving perceived performance and maintaining consistency.


# Q.10 Explain Debouncing and Create a project where you are using Debouncing.

üòÉ**Solution :**

Debouncing is a technique used in web development to control the frequency of a particular event, typically user input events like typing or scrolling. It helps in optimizing performance by reducing the number of times a function is executed during rapid or frequent events.

In simple terms, debouncing involves delaying the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last occurrence of the event. If the event occurs again within that time period, the timer is reset, and the function execution is delayed further.

Here's an example project that demonstrates the use of debouncing in JavaScript:
```Javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Debouncing Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <input type="text" id="search-input" placeholder="Search...">
  <ul id="search-results"></ul>

  <script>
    // Debouncing function
    function debounce(func, delay) {
      let timeoutId;
      
      return function() {
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);
        
        timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
          func.apply(this, arguments);
        }, delay);
      };
    }

    // Function to perform search operation
    function performSearch(event) {
      const searchTerm = event.target.value;
      const searchResultsElement = document.getElementById('search-results');
      
      // Simulating an API call or heavy operation
      // Here, we're simply appending the search term to the search results list
      searchResultsElement.innerHTML += `<li>${searchTerm}</li>`;
    }

    // Get the search input element
    const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');

    // Debounce the performSearch function with a delay of 300 milliseconds
    const debouncedSearch = debounce(performSearch, 300);

    // Add event listener to the search input with debounced function
    searchInput.addEventListener('input', debouncedSearch);
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```


# Q.11 Explain Closures and Use cases of Closures.

üòÉ**Solution :**

In JavaScript, a closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment in which that function was declared. It allows a function to access variables and resources from its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. In simpler terms, a closure "remembers" the variables and context in which it was created.

Closures are formed when an inner function is defined within an outer function and the inner function refers to variables from the outer function. The inner function retains a reference to the variables and scope of its outer function, even if the outer function has already returned.

Here's an example to illustrate closures:
```Javascript
function outer() {
  var outerVariable = 'Hello';

  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return inner;
}

var closure = outer();
closure(); // Output: Hello
```

Closures are frequently used in JavaScript for object data privacy, in event handlers and callback functions, and in partial applications, currying, and other functional programming patterns.


# ‚Üê React ‚Üí



# Q.1 What‚Äôs React and What are the advantages of it?

üòÉ**Solution :**

ReactJS is lightweight, creating a JavaScript library that accelerates UI development with shortcut paths and reusable UI components. React JS can manage the view layer of all your front-end web applications and mobile apps.
### Advantage of ReactJS:
- Easy to Learn and USe.
- Creating Dynamic Web Applications Becomes Easier.
- Reusable Components.
- Performance Enhancement.
- The Support of Handy Tools.
- Known to be SEO Friendly.
- The Benefit of Having JavaScript Library.
- Scope for Testing the Codes.


# Q.2 What's Virtual Dom in React & What are the advantages of it?

üòÉ**Solution :**

The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept in React that represents a virtual representation of the actual DOM. It is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to efficiently update and render components.

In React, when a component's state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM tree by applying the component's render method.

### The advantages of using the Virtual DOM in React are:
- Performance Optimization: Updating the real DOM can be an expensive operation, especially when dealing with large and complex applications. The Virtual DOM allows React to perform efficient updates by minimizing the number of actual manipulations on the real DOM. React identifies the minimal set of changes needed and performs them in a batch, resulting in improved performance.
- Simplified Programming Model: The Virtual DOM provides an abstraction layer that simplifies the programming model. Developers can focus on writing declarative components and let React handle the efficient rendering and updating of the virtual and real DOM. This abstraction allows for cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Cross-platform Consistency: The Virtual DOM ensures consistent behavior across different platforms and browsers. React abstracts away the differences and inconsistencies in the underlying browser implementations of the DOM, providing a unified programming model. Developers can write code once and have it work consistently across various platforms.
- Facilitates Reconciliation: The Virtual DOM makes it easier for React to perform reconciliation, which is the process of determining the minimal set of changes required to update the DOM. By comparing the previous and current virtual DOM trees, React can efficiently identify the differences and update only the necessary parts, minimizing the impact on performance.
- Server-side Rendering: React's Virtual DOM is also beneficial for server-side rendering. With the ability to generate a virtual DOM representation of the component tree on the server, React can render the initial HTML on the server and send it to the client. This allows for faster initial page loads and improved SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

```
    Speed and performance boost.
    Lightweight.
    It is simple and clear.
    Amazing diffing algorithm.
    It can be used on other frameworks not just react.
```


# Q.3 Explain LifeCycle of React Components?

üòÉ**Solution :**

In React, components have a lifecycle that consists of different phases and methods. These lifecycle methods allow you to perform specific actions at different points in a component's existence, from initialization to unmounting. The lifecycle of a React component can be divided into three main phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Here's an overview of each phase and the corresponding lifecycle methods:

#### Mounting Phase:
- This phase occurs when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
- Lifecycle methods involved: constructor(), static getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), componentDidMount().
- constructor(): This is the first method called when a component is created. It is used to initialize state and bind event handlers.
- static getDerivedStateFromProps(): This method is invoked before rendering and allows a component to update its state based on changes in props.
- render(): This method returns the JSX or elements to be rendered in the DOM.
- componentDidMount(): This method is called after the component has been rendered and inserted into the DOM. It is often used for performing side effects, such as fetching data or setting up event listeners.

#### Updating Phase:
- This phase occurs when a component's props or state change, triggering a re-render.
- Lifecycle methods involved: static getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(), componentDidUpdate().
- static getDerivedStateFromProps(): This method is called again during the updating phase, allowing the component to update its state based on changes in props.
- shouldComponentUpdate(): This method determines if the component should re-render or not. It is used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary renders.
- render(): This method returns the updated JSX or elements to be rendered.
- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): This method is invoked right before changes are made to the DOM. It allows you to capture some information from the DOM before it is potentially updated.
- componentDidUpdate(): This method is called after the component has been re-rendered and any changes in the DOM have been applied. It is often used for updating the DOM or performing additional side effects.

#### Unmounting Phase:
- This phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM.
- Lifecycle method involved: componentWillUnmount().
- componentWillUnmount(): This method is called right before a component is unmounted and removed from the DOM. It is used to clean up any resources, such as timers or event listeners, set up during the component's lifetime.


# Q.4 Whats the difference between Functional Components and Class Components?

üòÉ**Solution :**

### Functional Components:
#### Syntax: 
Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions. They are simpler and have a more concise syntax compared to class components.
#### State management: 
Until React 16.7, functional components were stateless and couldn't manage their own state. However, with the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can now use the useState hook to manage state. Hooks provide a way to use state and other React features in functional components, making them more powerful and flexible.
#### Lifecycle methods: 
Functional components can use lifecycle-related hooks like useEffect and useLayoutEffect to perform side effects and handle component lifecycle events. Hooks provide a more unified and concise approach compared to the traditional lifecycle methods used in class components.
#### Context: 
Functional components can consume context using the useContext hook, providing access to context values without wrapping the component in a context consumer.
#### Performance: 
Functional components can be more performant due to optimizations made by React with the introduction of Hooks. Functional components can also leverage the benefits of the React Fiber architecture for more efficient rendering and updates.

### Class Components:
#### Syntax: 
Class components are defined as JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class. They require a more verbose syntax with the use of render() method and lifecycle methods.
#### State management: 
Class components have built-in support for managing state using the this.state and this.setState() methods. They can handle state changes and trigger re-rendering of the component.
#### Lifecycle methods: 
Class components have a range of lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount(), which allow you to perform actions at specific points in the component's lifecycle.
#### Context: 
Class components can consume context using the this.context property or by wrapping the component with a context consumer.
#### Legacy usage: 
Class components have been the traditional way of defining components in React and are still widely used in existing codebases. They provide compatibility with older versions of React and certain third-party libraries that rely on class components.
    
    
# Q.5 What are the hooks in React & Can we use Hooks in Class Components?

üòÉ**Solution :**

Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a way to reuse stateful logic and manage component state without the need for class components.

Hooks enable you to break down complex components into smaller, reusable functions that are easier to read, test, and maintain.

### Some commonly used React hooks include:
- useState: Allows functional components to manage local state.
- useEffect: Enables performing side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or modifying the DOM.
- useContext: Provides access to a React context from within a functional component.
- useReducer: Allows state management with a reducer function, similar to how it's done in Redux.
- useCallback: Memoizes a function to prevent unnecessary re-renders in child components.
- useMemo: Memoizes the result of a function to optimize expensive calculations.
- useRef: Provides a mutable reference that persists across re-renders.

Regarding the use of hooks in class components, hooks are designed specifically for functional components. They cannot be directly used in class components. However, if you have a class component and you want to use hooks functionality, you can consider using the react-hooks-helper library or converting the class component into a functional component using the function syntax.


# Q.6 What are the LifeCycle method and the advantages of it?

üòÉ**Solution :**

In React, lifecycle methods are special methods that are invoked at different stages of a component's lifecycle. They allow you to perform specific actions at key points in the lifecycle, such as when a component is mounted, updated, or unmounted. However, it's important to note that with the introduction of React Hooks, some lifecycle methods are being replaced by Hooks.

### Advantages of Lifecycle Methods:
- Control over component behavior: Lifecycle methods give you control over what happens at each stage of a component's lifecycle. This allows you to perform initialization, cleanup, or additional logic as needed.
- Optimization and performance: By using lifecycle methods effectively, you can optimize the rendering and updating process of components. For example, you can avoid unnecessary re-renders or perform conditional updates based on specific conditions.
- Integration with external libraries and APIs: Lifecycle methods are often used to integrate with external libraries or APIs. For example, you can initialize and clean up subscriptions, set up event listeners, or interact with third-party JavaScript libraries.
-Access to the DOM: Certain lifecycle methods provide access to the DOM, allowing you to manipulate the DOM directly or perform actions that require knowledge of the DOM structure.
- Side effects and asynchronous operations: Lifecycle methods provide opportunities to perform side effects, such as making AJAX requests, updating state asynchronously, or performing animations.


# Q.7 What‚Äôs useState Hook & Advantages of it?

üòÉ**Solution :**

In React, the useState hook is a built-in hook that allows functional components to manage state. It provides a way to declare and update state variables within a component without the need for class components or using the this keyword.

The useState hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state. You can initialize the state with an initial value, and the hook returns the current value and a function to modify it. Whenever the state is updated using the state update function, React re-renders the component and reflects the new state value.

Here's an example of how to use useState:
```Javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
### Advantages of useState:
- Simplicity: useState simplifies state management in functional components by providing a straightforward API. It eliminates the need for class components and the complexities associated with them, making the code more concise and easier to understand.
- Functional purity: With useState, state updates are done immutably, preserving the functional programming principle of immutability. The state update function provided by useState creates a new state value based on the previous state, ensuring that updates do not mutate the existing state directly.
- Multiple state variables: Unlike the traditional this.state in class components, useState allows you to declare multiple independent state variables within a single component. You can call useState multiple times to manage different pieces of state within the same component, providing better organization and modularity.
- Automatic re-rendering: When the state is updated using the state update function, React automatically re-renders the component and reflects the new state value. This enables seamless UI updates based on the current state, ensuring that the component always stays in sync with the data it manages.
- Hooks integration: useState is part of the Hooks API in React, which allows you to use other hooks and build custom hooks. Hooks provide a consistent way to manage state, side effects, and other features in functional components, promoting code reuse and modularity.

Overall, useState is a fundamental hook in React that enables functional components to manage state. It offers simplicity, functional purity, automatic re-rendering, and integration with other hooks, making state management in React more intuitive and efficient


# Q.8 Explain useEffect & Advantages of it.

üòÉ**Solution :**

In React, the useEffect hook is a built-in hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects refer to any code that interacts with the external world, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, manipulating the DOM, or setting up timers.

The useEffect hook takes two arguments: a function that represents the side effect and an optional dependency array.

Here's an example of how to use useEffect:
```Javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const Timer = () => {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title with the current seconds
    document.title = `Timer: ${seconds}`;

    // Clean up the effect by stopping the timer
    return () => {
      clearInterval(timerId);
    };
  }, [seconds]);

  const timerId = setInterval(() => {
    setSeconds(prevSeconds => prevSeconds + 1);
  }, 1000);

  return <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;
};
```
### Advantages of useEffect:
- Separation of concerns: useEffect allows you to separate side effects from the main component logic. By encapsulating side effects within the effect function, you can keep your component code focused on rendering UI and managing state, improving code readability and maintainability.
- Lifecycle management: useEffect covers the functionality of lifecycle methods in class components, such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. You can handle side effects when the component mounts, updates, or unmounts by using the appropriate dependencies and cleanup functions.
- Asynchronous operations: useEffect is capable of handling asynchronous operations within the effect function. You can make API calls, fetch data, or perform any other asynchronous tasks using promises or async/await syntax. This allows you to manage asynchronous logic and update the component state accordingly.
- Dependency tracking: The dependency array in useEffect allows you to specify the dependencies that trigger the re-execution of the effect. This ensures that the effect runs only when the specified dependencies change, avoiding unnecessary re-execution and optimizing performance.
- Cleanup mechanism: useEffect provides a cleanup mechanism through the optional return function. This function is invoked when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change before the next effect execution. It allows you to clean up any resources or subscriptions created by the effect, preventing memory leaks and unnecessary computations.

Overall, useEffect is a versatile and powerful hook in React that enables you to manage side effects, handle asynchronous operations, and control the lifecycle of functional components. It promotes clean code organization, encapsulation of side effects, and efficient rendering.



# Q.9 Explain useReducer and Its advantages.

üòÉ**Solution :**

In React, useReducer is a built-in hook that provides an alternative to using the useState hook for managing complex state logic. It is primarily used when you have state transitions that are more intricate and involve multiple sub-values or require advanced state management.

The useReducer hook takes two arguments: a reducer function and an initial state. It returns an array with two elements: the current state and a dispatch function. The reducer function receives the current state and an action, and it returns the new state based on the action type.

Here's an example of how to use useReducer:
```Javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

// Reducer function
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Component using useReducer
const Counter = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  const increment = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Advantages of useReducer:
- Simplified state management: useReducer is useful when managing complex state transitions. It allows you to handle state changes based on different actions in a single centralized reducer function, making the state management logic easier to understand and maintain.
- Centralized logic: By using a reducer function, you can centralize all state transitions and side effects related to a specific piece of state. This improves code organization and reduces duplication of logic.
- Predictable state updates: useReducer follows the same principles as the traditional reducer pattern, making state updates predictable. The reducer function takes the current state and an action and returns the new state, ensuring that updates are consistent and deterministic.
- Suitable for complex state: When your state contains multiple sub-values or requires more advanced logic, such as updating multiple state properties simultaneously or performing asynchronous operations, useReducer provides a more flexible solution compared to useState.
- Integration with context: useReducer can be used in conjunction with the Context API in React, allowing you to manage global state or share state across components without the need for prop drilling.

Overall, useReducer is a powerful hook that provides a structured and predictable approach to managing state in complex scenarios. It promotes code organization, reduces duplication, and improves maintainability of your React components.


# Q.10 Explain Prop Drilling & How can we avoid it?

üòÉ**Solution :**

Prop drilling occurs when a parent component passes data down to its children and then those children pass the same data down to their own children. This process can continue indefinitely. At the end, it's a long chain of component dependencies that can be difficult to manage and maintain.

### Prop drilling can lead to several issues:
- It adds unnecessary complexity and verbosity to the codebase.
- It can make the code harder to understand and maintain as the number of components increases.
- It tightly couples components together, making it difficult to modify or refactor them independently.

### To avoid prop drilling, you can employ a couple of techniques:
- Context API: The Context API in React allows you to create a shared state or data that can be accessed by multiple components without passing props explicitly. You can define a context at a higher level in the component tree and provide the required values to it. Then, the nested components can access these values without the need for prop drilling. Context API provides a way to avoid prop drilling by establishing a direct connection between the source of the data and the consuming components.
- Redux or other state management libraries: Redux is a popular state management library for React applications. It allows you to centralize and manage the state of your application in a single store. By using Redux or similar libraries, you can store the required data in the global state and access it from any component in the application without the need for prop drilling.
    

# ‚Üê Express ‚Üí

# Q.1 What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### Authentication: 
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity attempting to access a system. It confirms that the user is who they claim to be. Authentication typically involves presenting credentials such as a username and password, biometric information, security tokens, or digital certificates to prove identity. The goal of authentication is to ensure that only legitimate users gain access to the system.

#### Authorization: 
Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying permissions and privileges to authenticated users. Once a user's identity has been established through authentication, authorization determines what actions or resources the user is allowed to access within the system. Authorization is based on predefined rules, access control lists (ACLs), or roles assigned to users. It ensures that authenticated users have appropriate rights and permissions to perform specific actions or access certain resources.

Notes--> authentication is about verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is about determining what the user is allowed to do or access once their identity has been established.


# Q.2 What is he difference between common JS and EJS module?

üòÉ**Solution :**

#### CommonJS (CJS):
- CommonJS is a module system primarily used in server-side JavaScript environments, such as Node.js.
- It uses the require() function to import modules and the module.exports or exports object to define the exports of a module.
- CJS modules have a synchronous nature, where dependencies are resolved at runtime.

```Javascript
// greet.js
const message = 'Hello, ';

function greet(name) {
  console.log(message + name);
}

module.exports = greet;
```
```Javascript
// main.js
const greet = require('./greet');

greet('John'); // Output: Hello, John
```

#### EJS (ECMAScript Modules):
- It uses import and export statements to handle module imports and exports.
- EJS modules are asynchronous and have a static nature, where dependencies are resolved statically at the time of module loading.

```Javascript
// greet.js
const message = 'Hello, ';

export function greet(name) {
  console.log(message + name);
}
```

```Javascript
// main.js
import { greet } from './greet';

greet('John'); // Output: Hello, John
```


# Q.3 What should we do with the password of a user before storing it into DB?

üòÉ**Solution :**

When handling user passwords, it is essential to follow security best practices to protect sensitive information. Here are some recommended steps to handle user passwords before storing them in a database:
- Hashing: Passwords should never be stored in plain text. Instead, they should be hashed using a strong cryptographic hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt. Hashing is a one-way process that transforms the password into a fixed-length string of characters. The resulting hash cannot be reverse-engineered to obtain the original password.
- Salt: To further enhance the security of hashed passwords, it is recommended to use a unique salt for each user. A salt is a random value that is added to the password before hashing. Salting helps prevent attacks such as rainbow table attacks, where precomputed hash values are compared against stored hashes.
- Strong Hashing Algorithm: Choose a secure and widely accepted hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, which are specifically designed for password hashing. These algorithms incorporate features like adjustable work factor and memory hardness to protect against brute-force attacks.
- Work Factor and Iterations: Configure the hashing algorithm with an appropriate work factor or iteration count. A higher work factor or iteration count increases the computational cost required to hash the password, making it more difficult for attackers to crack passwords using brute-force or dictionary attacks.
- Server-Side Hashing: Perform password hashing on the server-side rather than on the client-side. This ensures that the plaintext password never leaves the server and reduces the risk of interception or tampering.
- Secure Transport: When transmitting passwords over a network, use secure protocols such as HTTPS to encrypt the communication and prevent interception or eavesdropping.
- Strong Access Controls: Protect the database that stores user passwords with strong access controls. Only authorized personnel should have access to the database.

By following these practices, you can significantly enhance the security of user passwords and minimize the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts.


# Q.4 Whats event loop in NodeJS?

üòÉ**Solution :**

In Node.js, the event loop is a fundamental part of its runtime environment. It is responsible for handling asynchronous operations, such as I/O operations, timers, and callbacks, in an efficient and non-blocking manner.

The event loop allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent operations without getting blocked, which is crucial for building scalable and high-performance applications. It enables Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

Let's go through an example to illustrate how the event loop works in Node.js.

```Javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Callback 1");
}, 2000);

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Callback 2");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
/*
Output:
Start
End
Callback 2
Callback 1
*/
```
